# MySonicPi 🎶

Welcome to MySonicPi repo where I throw some music notes and coding segments into a mixer(Sonic Pi)🍹 On a *serious* note, **I'm not Mozart** - but I love beats with a good vibe and thought, "Why not code it!". 

## What's going on here? 🤔
- Coding famous beats that you probably know (and hopefully love), like "Still D.R.E." and other classics
- I’m **not writing original music** (unless you count me pretending to be a DJ/programmer hybrid). I'm just **coding the music** that already exists
- It’s all about making music using code, experimenting with sound, and figuring out what happens when I push random buttons (most of the time, it sounds pretty cool)

## Why Sonic Pi? 🎧
- Sound + Code = 🎉🪩🎊
- Music as code: I love the idea of using programming to make music, and Sonic Pi is the perfect platform for that
- Learning: By recreating existing tracks, I get to dive deep into how they’re structured and try to replicate those structures in code

And if you think this is just me goofing around, check out **DJ Dave**—she’s a pro showing what Sonic Pi can really do on stage. Definitely the real-life proof of the magic behind this tool!

Be sure to check out Sonic Pi [https://sonic-pi.net/] —it’s an amazing platform for live coding music. Huge shoutout to Sam Aaron and the Sonic Pi team for creating such a fun and powerful tool!
